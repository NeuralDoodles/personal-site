# Some history

- My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 1998 when I was 2. My favorite games were Prince, Wolfenstein 3D, and Mario. I was really small and did not knoq how to play, but I loved watching my parent play those games.

- I lived in Egypt for a year or so, when I was 4. My apartment faced the Suez canal and my favourite passtime was to watch the ships go by.
